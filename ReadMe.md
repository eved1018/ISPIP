### Motivation: 
<p>Identifying protein interfaces is important to learn how proteins interact with their binding partners, to uncover the regulatory mechanisms to control biological functions and to develop novel therapeutic agents. A variety of computational approaches have been developed for predicting a proteinâ€™s interfacial residues from its sequence features, such as physico-chemical properties of residues, as well as using structure-based information from known interfaces that share high sequence or structure similarity. Structure-based methods that rely on finding suitable templates will not be successful in predicting interfaces when structural homologues with known complex structures are not available. <p>
<p> In this work, we describe the development of an integrated method to explore the hypothesis that the efficacy of a computational prediction method of protein binding sites can be enhanced by using a combination of methods that rely on orthogonal structure-based properties of a query protein, combining and balancing both template-free and template-based features. ISPIP is a method that integrates these approaches by linear or logistic regression, random forest, or Gradient boosted tree models. ISPIP on a diverse test set of query proteins outperforms each of its individual classifiers in identifying protein binding interfaces.</p>

<h3> Requirements: </h3>

* python3  (tested with 3.7 and above)
* packages listed in requirements.txt to install execute 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' 	
* optional: pymol, dtreeviz and graphviz

<h3>Usage: </h3>
	
- `git clone https://github.com/eved1018/ISPIP.git`
- `cd ISPIP`
- `python -m ISPIP` 


<h3>Arguments:</h3>

- Input/Output:
	* `-if`: [str] default: input - Directory containing input data.
	* `-of`: [str] default: output - Directory to place output of MeatDPI.
	* `-i`: [str] default: input.csv - Csv file should be in input folder.
	* `-cv`: [str] default: cv - Directory containing test and train sets for cross-validation. 
	* `-trainset`: [str] default: test_set.txt - Filename containing proteins for models to train on should be in input folder.
	* `-testset`: [str] default: train_set.txt - Filename containing proteins for models to test on should be in input folder.
	* `-cutoffs`: [str] default:'cutoffs.csv' - Filename containing length of interface or precalculated cutoff for each protein. 
	* `-model_name`: [str] default:'model' - Name of models to import/export.


- Mode selection:
	* `-mode`: ['predict', 'test', 'generate','cv','viz'] default: 'predict'  
		* __predict__: Use pre-trained model in input folder to predict on set.
		* __generate__: Generate a new rf model from a test set without predicting on any data.
		* __test__: Generate a new rf model from a test set and train on a training set.
		* __viz__: Only call the pymol visualization function.
		* __cv__: perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning of models on split training set, the best models are then used to predict on a designated testing set. 


- Parameters: 
	* `-randomforest_parameter_trees`: [integer] default: 10 - Scikit learn 'n_estimators' parameter.
	* `-random_forest_parameter_depth`: [integer] default: None - Scikit learn 'max_depth' parameter.
	* `-random_forest_parameter_ccp`: [float] default: 0.0 - Scikit learn 'ccp_alpha' parameter. (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#minimal-cost-complexity-pruning).
	* `-autocutoff`: [int] default: 15 - If no cutoff file is used this sets the default interface cutoff value.


- Flags: 
	* `-pymol`: Output pymol session and image of protein with experimental and predicted interfaces overladed. 
	* `-tv`: Output svg image of a randomly sampled tree (for large datasets this can take up a huge amount of time and space) see https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz for details.
	* `-xg`: Include the use of gradient boosting regression model.
	* `-nn`: Include the use of Multi-layer Perceptron regressor model.


Output:

- results.csv: this file contains the fscore, MCC, Roc AUC and PR AUC for each individual method and model. 

- roc_model.csv and pr_model.csv: the TRP and FPR by threshold for each individual method and model, can be used to generate specific ROC or PR graphs.

- fscore_mcc_by_protein: the individual fscore and mcc for each protein in the test set. 

- *.joblib: the trained models from a generate, test or cv run. Move these into the input directory to be used with 'predict' mode. 

- pairtest.csv: Comparison of statistical significance between AUCs.
	- top triangle: difference in pairs of AUCs
	- bottom triangle: log(10) of p-values for the difference in pairs of AUCs.
- proteins: Directory containing pymol sessions for each protein in the test set.  
- cvout: Directory containing the best parameters for each model used in the final prediction, as well as the individual metrics over each cross validation step.
